> **S**tructuring **I**ncoming **E**mails for **V**aluable **E**xtraction

SIEVE is a web application that automatically structures, analyzes, and enriches incoming emails with company-internal
knowledge. Relevant contents are extracted via an LLM-based backend and transformed into structured data, enabling
faster processing and supporting standardized workflows.

This repository contains the backend, as well as the frontend of the SIEVE application.
